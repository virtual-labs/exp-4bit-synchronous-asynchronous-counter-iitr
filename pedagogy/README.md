#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This Experiment Contains two Sections one for Synchronous Counter and Asynchronous Counter. Each section gives freedom to the user to change binary I/P according to him and also to predict the output based on his previous knowledge.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Display the simulator window for the particular simulator.|  Choose a Counter| To perform an experiment on a particular Counter.
2.| Input and Output will be added to input with corresponding remarks | TEnter the Binary inputs and corresponding outputs according to his Knowledge and then click on Check. | To check the knowledge of the operation of Counter.
3.|Display Circuit corresponding to the particular Counter.| Click on “Circuit” Button..| To verify the truth table with the help of circuit
diagram.
4.| Clear all the input and Output Fields | Click on “Reset” button.| To clear the truth table for new values.
