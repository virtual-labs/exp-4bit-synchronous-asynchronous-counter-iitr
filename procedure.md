#### Synchronous Counter

Step-1) Press Switch to supply 5V to the circuit.<br/>
        The switch in ON state is <img src="images/switchon1.png" width="30" height="40"> and the switch in OFF state is <img src="images/switchoff1.png" width="30" height="40"><br/>
Step-2) Press Counter button to start the counter.<br/>
Step-3) Different combination of LEDs lit up for different combination of inputs.<br/>
        The LED in OFF state is <img src="images/off1.png" width="50" height="40"> and the LED in ON state is <img src="images/on1.png" width="50" height="40"> .<br/>
        The data is simultaneously added to the Truth Table.<br/>
Step-4) Repeat Steps 2 to 3 for another set of data.<br/>
Step-5) Click on "Generate Waveform" Button to generate the Timing Diagram .<br/> 
Step-6) Click "Print" to get the print out of the Truth Table and the Timing Diagram.<br/>
